scenario 1
Predict ocean water temperature using environmental and depth-related features.
Dataset (Kaggle – Public): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi
Discription of the code:
              Ocean temperature is influenced by variables such as depth, salinity, oxygen level, latitude, and longitude. By using regression models (e.g., Linear Regression), we can learn the relationship between these features and temperature and predict continuous temperature values.

scenario 2
Classify whether LIC stock price will increase (1) or decrease (0) based on historical data.
Dataset (Kaggle – Public): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashis74017/lic-stock-price-data
Discription of the code:
              This program uses Logistic Regression to classify LIC stock price movement as increase or decrease based on historical data. The dataset is loaded and cleaned, and a binary target variable is created by comparing the closing and opening prices. The input features used are Open, High, Low, and Volume, and missing values are handled using mean substitution. Feature scaling is applied to improve model performance, and the data is split into training and testing sets. The Logistic Regression model is trained and evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix, and its performance is visualized using an ROC curve and a feature importance graph.
